    The MPL is a weak <a href="/licenses/copyleft/" title="copyleft licenses">copyleft</a> license. You must share your source code or materials when you distribute your work, but only for the parts under the MPL. You can combine an MPL work with works covered by other licenses and share the combined work under different terms. The MPL also includes a patent grant from contributors. The license is compatible with the GPL and LGPL, allowing you to relicense an MPL work under those licenses, which are stronger copyleft licenses.

    The MPL requires you include notices in parts of your work if you can. There are two notices you can include. You should always include <a href='#notice-a---license-notice' title="notice a">notice a</a>, which tells people that the work is licensed under the Plain MPL. If you distribute the work in a way that isn't compatible with other licenses, you must also include  <a href='#notice-b---incompatible-license-notice' title='notice b'>notice b</a>.

    ## We Give You a License to Use, Change, and Share This Work

    **We, the authors and contributors, give you a free, worldwide license to this work.** Everyone else gets the same license too.

    **With this license, you can:**

    - **Use, copy, change, and distribute the work** in any format *(intellectual property rights)*
    - **Use, sell, transfer, or offer the work** for sale *(patent rights)*

    This license covers:

    - The original work and any changes made by contributors
    - Any changes you or others make to the work
    - Any parts of the work included with other works

    ## Limits to This License

    **You <em>only</em> have the rights we spell out here. Your rights don't cover:**

    - Any part of the work a contributor removes
    - Changes to the work that violate someone else's patent or other intellectual property rights (for example, if you combine the work with another work that causes infringement).
    - Patent claims against parts of the work that don't include our contributions
    - Any trademarks, service marks, or logos of any contributor

    If you re-license the work under a different license of version of this license, you don't get any new rights from us.

    ## Your License Doesn't Limit Your 'Fair Use' Rights

    This license doesn't limit your rights to make fair use (or 'fair dealing') of the work under copyright laws.[^1]

    [^1]: Fair use and fair dealing are legal ideas that let you use copyrighted works in certain ways without permission. For example, you can use a small part of a copyrighted work for a review or to teach a class. The rules for fair use and fair dealing vary by country. You can learn more about fair use in the United States from the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/index.html).

    ## Contributor Promises

    Each contributor promises: **The work is original**. We made the work or have the right to give it to you under this license.

    ## Conditions

    To keep your license:

    - **Keep all copyright, patent, trademark, or credit notices in the work.** You can fix false information in the notices.
    - **License any changes you make to the work under this license**. Include a copy of this license when you share your changes.

    ## Using this Work in a Larger Work

    You can use this work (or parts of it) in something bigger. You can license a larger work under another license if:

    - The license for the larger work doesn't change the license for the parts of the work under this license.
    - You don't change or limit anyone's rights under this license.
    - You include a copy of this license with the parts of the work that stay under this license.

    The people who get the larger work can choose to use the parts of the work under this license or the other license.

    ### Main Ideas

    `separate parts`

    :   This license covers discrete, or separate, parts of a biggr work, like a software module in a bigger program, or a chapter in a book. You can have separate parts of a work under this license and other licenses.

    `larger work`

    :  A project that includes the Plain MPL-licensed work with other content. For example:

        - A book that includes text or illustrations under this license
        - Software that includes some code under this license with other code under a different license
        - A website that uses design elements under this license
        - A game that uses music or images under this license

    `source form`

    :  The most editable form of the work.

        - For software: source code
        - For a book: the raw text (e.g., a Word or text file)
        - For images: the layered or vector file (e.g., a `.psd` or `.svg` file)

    `compatible licenses`

    :  Licenses that work well with the Plain MPL. For example, the [GPL (v2 or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), [LGPL (v2.1 or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) and [Affero GPL (v3 or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). When you combine Plain MPL-licensed work with work under those licenses, you can share it under those terms, as long as you also follow any rules requiring re-licensing under the Plain MPL (if they apply). Similarly, licenses like MIT that allow you to re-license under this license are also compatible.

    ### Mixing this Work into a Larger Work

    If you make a larger work that includes this work, you can choose a different license for the larger work *if you offer the parts of the larger work covered by this license*:
    - **Under the same terms** as this license, or as a choice between this license and the other license.
    - **Without changing or limiting anyone's rights** under this license.
    - **Include a copy of this license**.

    Anyone who gets the larger work can choose to use the parts covered by the Plain MPL under this license or any other license you offer.

    ## Sharing the Work

    **When you share the work, you must:**

    - **Share the source form of the work** under this license.
    - **Tell people the work is under this license** and give them a copy of this license with the parts you share.
    - **Not limit or change the rights of people who you share the work with.**
    - **Make the source form available** in a way that allows people to easily get and use it. If sharing the source form costs money (e.g., copying or shipping costs), you can charge a small fee to cover the cost, but you should try to find a way to share it for free.

    You can still share a version of the work people can’t change or see the source for (like a compiled app or a final PDF), and even license that version differently.

    - The new license can't stop people from easily getting the source form of the parts under this license.
    - You must provide a practical way for them to get the source form.

    ## We Offer No Warranty and Limit Our Liability

    Use the work at your own risk.

    - **We provide the work "as is" with no guarantees**.
    - We aren't responsible for any problems or damages caused by using the work (e.g., financial loss, data lodd, physical injury)
    - We don't have to fix any problems you find with the work.

    You may offer a warranty yourself, but you must clearly state it’s your warranty, not ours. If we get sued because of your warranty, you agree to cover our costs.

    ## How You Can Lose (or Regain) Your Rights

    You usually get one chance to fix mistakes before you lose your rights, unless you sue us for patent infringement -- then you lose your rights permanently.

    If you...   | and...        | Then you...
    |------------|---------------|-------------------|
    break these terms for the first time | - You catch it yourself and fix it within 60 days <br> **OR** <br> - Someone tells you, and you fix it within 30 days | Get your rights back
    Break these terms again (second offense) | *no matter how you find out or how quickly you fix it* | permanently lose your rights
    sue someone for patent infringement  | the patent claim includes this work  | lose your rights permanently
    issued end-user licenses to others | you lose your rights | end-user licenses stay in effect

    If you lose your rights, you can't get them back. We don't have to warn you before that happens.

    ## Future Versions of This License

    [Plain License](https://plainlicense.org) maintains this license based on the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

    You can share the work under any version of this license published by Plain License. If Plain License releases a new version, you may use the newer version. You can also use the work under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/) or a later version published by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/) [^2].

    [^2]: Plain License isn't affiliated with the Mozilla Foundation. Please don’t relicense something already covered by the original Mozilla Public License 2.0 under the Plain MPL unless Mozilla says the two licenses are compatible.

    ## If Your Laws Prevent Following This License

    If your local laws or regulations stop you from following any term of this license, you must:

    - Follow all other terms as closely as you can.
    - Explain which parts you can’t follow and why, using clear, plain language, and include this explanation with every copy of the work you share.


    ## Defedendant's Courts and Laws

    If you sue the authors under this license, you must do it in the courts where the defendant (the person or organization you sued) is located. Their local laws will apply. You can still file counter-claims or cross-claims if you’re sued first.

    ## Other Terms

    - This license is our entire agreement. We aren’t giving you any other rights or promises.
    - If a court can’t enforce part of this agreement, it may change that part just enough to make it enforceable, leaving the rest of the license as is.
    - Some places interpret contracts in favor of the person who didn’t write them. Those laws don’t apply here, because the authors chose this standard, publicly available license to help everyone, not just themselves.

    ## How to Provide Notices

    If you share the work in a format where it’s hard to embed notices (like certain binaries or images):

    - Put notices in a LICENSE file or somewhere else visible when people get the work.
    - Include a notice that the work is under the Plain MPL (see [Notice A](#notice-a---you-may-use-this-work-under-the-Plain-MPL)).

    You may make your shared version incompatible with the GPL, LGPL, or Affero GPL (meaning people can’t relicense under them), you need to include [Notice B](#notice-b---you-can't-share-this-work-under-the-GPL-LGPL-or-Affero-GPL) along with [Notice A](#notice-a---you-may-use-this-work-under-the-Plain-MPL) wherever you display license info.

    If you share the work in a format where it’s hard to embed notices (like certain binaries or images):

    - Put notices in a LICENSE file or somewhere else people can easily see them.
    - Include a notice that the work is under the Plain MPL (see Notice A).

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

    become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
    distributes such Contribution.

    ### 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
    Contributor:

    -   **(a)** for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
        or
    -   **(b)** for infringements caused by: **(i)** Your and any other third party's
        modifications of Covered Software, or **(ii)** the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or
    -   **(c)** under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.

    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    ### 2.4. Subsequent Licenses

    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    ### 2.5. Representation

    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    ### 2.6. Fair Use

    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
    applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other

    ### 2.7. Conditions

    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
    in Section 2.1.

    ## 3. Responsibilities

    ### 3.1. Distribution of Source Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form.

    ### 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    -   **(a)** such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
        Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
        the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
        Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
        than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

    -   **(b)** You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
        the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    ### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
    License(s).

    ### 3.4. Notices

    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    ### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms

    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
    jurisdiction.

    ## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: **(a)** comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and **(b)**
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

    ## 5. Termination

    **5.1.** The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until such
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and **(b)** on an
    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
    Your receipt of the notice.

    **5.2.** If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    **5.3.** In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
    prior to termination shall survive termination.

    ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

    > Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is”
    > basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
    > statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
    > Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
    > particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
    > quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
    > Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
    > (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
    > repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
    > essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
    > authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

    ## 7. Limitation of Liability

    > Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
    > (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
    > Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
    > permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
    > special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
    > including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
    > goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
    > and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
    > shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
    > limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
    > personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
    > extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
    > jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    > incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
    > limitation may not apply to You.

    ## 8. Litigation

    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
    courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
    Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
    cross-claims or counter-claims.

    ## 9. Miscellaneous

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
    shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

    ## 10. Versions of the License

    ### 10.1. New Versions

    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
    10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
    publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.

    ### 10.2. Effect of New Versions

    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
    of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
    or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
    steward.

    ### 10.3. Modified Versions

    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
    create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
    modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
    such modified license differs from this License).

    ### 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
    Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
    notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
