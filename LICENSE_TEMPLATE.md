# BASE TEMPLATE FOR LICENSE PAGES
#
# This template is used to generate the license pages on the site
# Page structure is the same for all licenses, and is generated by the scripts
# You can edit the page structure in overrides/license.html, and its child templates:
# overrides/partials/license_tags.html, overrides/partials/license_content.html
# overrides/partials/license_disclaimer_block.html and overrides/partials/license_toc.html
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# TEXT FIELDS:
#      - Avoid using quotes in the text fields; instead use literal blocks (| for
#     multiline and > for single line with the text indented on the next line)
#     - **Please don't use reference link tags on license pages. Use in-line links.**
#       I love reference links, too, but they complicate license processing.
#
# Steps:
# 1) !!IMPORTANT: replace all {{ variables }} with the appropriate information
#     You can use find and replace to fill the variables in this template
#     Variables are: plain_name, original_name, spdx_id, original_url,
#     original_organization, original_version, category, license_description,
#     instructions, notes, outro, reader_license_text, official_license_text
#     (all in the format {{ variable }})
#
# 2) Remove tags that don't apply to the license for permissions, conditions,
#     limitations. These are from choosealicense.com's tagging system
#     https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com#license-metadata
#
# 4) Fill in the outro if needed. The outro field is APPENDED to the license page
#    (it appears below the license). If you keep it empty, change the value to `null`. It
#     is empty on most licenses. Use it for unique information about the license.
#     For an example, see [Plain Elastic License](https://plainlicense.org/licenses/source-available/elastic-2.0/)
#
# 5) Fill in the reader_license_text and official_license_text fields with the
#   appropriate information. These fields are used to generate the license tabs on the
#   license page. Reader license text is the plain language version of the license.
#   Official license text is the original license text.
#     NOTE:
#         - **DO NOT INCLUDE THE TITLE AND VERSIONS FOR license text.** Start with the
#         first section of the license text. The title and versions are generated
#         automatically. Headers and text are not.
#         - Don't include an interpretation, not-legal-advice, or not-official section;
#           those are generated automatically.
#
# 6) Save the file in the appropriate directory (docs/licenses/{{category}}/{spdx-id}}/index.md.
#     Don't worry about removing these comments; we'll take care of that when we generate the license page.
# template: don't change this; it's used to generate the license page

# CHOOSE A LICENSE TAGS
# We use choosealicense.com's tagging system; we haven't fully implemented this yet, but we
# will in the future. Their system divides tags into permissions, conditions, and limitations
# SELECT ONLY TAGS THAT APPLY TO THE LICENSE, AND REMOVE THE REST. If the license is already on choosealicense.com,
# please use the same tags as on their site. You can find all choosealicense.com licenses and their tags at
# https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/PlainLicense/external/choosealicense.com/_licenses_/
# If the license is not on choosealicense.com, use the tags that best describe the license
# Descriptions of the tags are here:
# https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/PlainLicense/external/choosealicense.com/_data/rules.yml
# AS APPLICABLE:
permissions:
  - distribution
  - commercial-use
  - modifications
  - patent-use
  - private-use
  - revokable # this isn't one of choosealicense.com's tags, but we need it because we have proprietary licenses
# AS APPLICABLE:
conditions:
  - disclose-source
  - document-changes
  - include-copyright
  - include-copyright
  - network-use-disclose
  - same-license # must use the same license for the entire project (full stack)
  - same-license--file # must use the same license for the same file, but not the project
  - same-license--library # must use the same license for the same library, but not the project
# AS APPLICABLE:
limitations:
  - liability # disclaims liability
  - patent-use # explicitly defines patent use rights
  - trademark-use # explicitly defines trademark use rights
  - warranty # disclaims warranty
# NOTE: The simplified tags you see on license pages with icon representations are added in the build process automatically. They are appended based on permissions, conditions, limitations
# The mapping is in the `license_factory.py` script in the `overrides/hooks` directory

# outro: outro text for the license page; this is appended to the page, below the license tabs. Optional and usually empty; if empty, change to `null`
outro: |
  null

# Optional additional instructions for how to use the license. This is appended to the stock `how` instructions from the boilerplate in the mkdocs.yml.
# This is usually empty, and null is the default value. When we do have instructions, most often the license itself gives them, so reference the license text with an anchor link,
# which is the header for that section of the license text. Example:
# ```markdown
# See [`How to Apply the Plain Apache to Your Work`](#how-to-apply-the-plain-apache-to-your-work "jump to additional license instructions")` section for information on applying the license to your work.
# ```
extra_how: null
# READER LICENSE TEXT (PLAIN LANGUAGE LICENSE)
# reader_license_text: this is the plain language version of the license text
# It is the Plain License version.
# Uses MKDocs markdown. Make it pretty. See [Writing Guidelines](plainlicense.org/helping/write.html)
# Scripts will automatically generate the rest of the tabs, text, and links
# Don't include the license title (e.g. Plain MIT); it is generated automatically
# All other headers are NOT generated automatically; include them in the text
# Don't use reference links in the license text; use in-line links instead
reader_license_text: |
  {{ reader_license_text }}

# OFFICIAL LICENSE TEXT
# official_license_text:
# If applicable, provide the mostly common/official license text for the original license.
# In MARKDOWN.
# Include its title and version number, if applicable; exactly as it usually appears.
# If you can't find the official text in markdown, check if it's at:
# https://github.com/IQAndreas/markdown-licenses . Otherwise, you might have to
# manually convert it to markdown (usually just adding header tags and fixing links).
# Reach out if you need help.cDon't use reference links in the license text; use in-line links instead
# if it's a Plain License original, set to null
official_license_text: |
  {{ official_license_text }}

# link_in_original: boolean, if the original license includes a link to the original_url, set to true
# If not, false. We'll add a link to the license when we generate the page using the original_url
link_in_original: false

# GUNNING FOG INDEXES
# Gunning Fog index for the original license text; we'll calculate this when we generate the page
# If you don't know what this is, don't worry about it; we'll take care of it
original_gunning_fog: null

# Gunning Fog index for the plain language license text; we'll calculate this when we generate the page
