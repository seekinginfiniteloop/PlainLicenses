# Plain Unlicense

Plain Version: 0.1.0

## We Dedicate This Work to the Public Domain

**The authors ("we") dedicate this work ("the work") to the public
domain.**
You can use it freely for any purpose and in any way you want. We give
away all rights and interest in the work to the public domain forever.

## You Can Do Anything with the Work

- **Use the work for anything** you want, in whole or in part.
- **Copy, change, publish, distribute, or sell** the work.
- Use the work for any purpose without restrictions.
- **License anything you create with the work however you want.**

**You do not need to do anything to use the work.** You do not need to
ask for permission, give credit, or pay us. You can use the work
without any restrictions.

## We Give You an Unrestricted License

Some courts do not recognize public domain dedications. For such
cases, we give you a license to use and change the work worldwide. You
and everyone else can use the work forever and never need to pay to
use it. No one can take this license from you.

## We Provide No Warranty and Accept No Liability

**We provide the work "as is" and offer no warranties.** We are not
responsible for any damages or issues from your use of the work.

### Legally Interpreting the Plain Unlicense

The Plain Unlicense is a plain language version of the Unlicense. We
wrote it to make the Unlicense more accessible and understandable. We
tried to match the Unlicense's legal intent. We didn't intend any
differences in meaning. **If you are using the Plain Unlicense in a
legal context, you should refer to the official Unlicense for
clarification.**

If a court finds that any part of this dedication can't be enforced,
the rest of the dedication terms still apply.
